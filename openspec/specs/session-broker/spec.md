# session-broker Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change bootstrap-remote-assistance-platform. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Pairing-based session join
The system SHALL require peers to join a brokered session using an explicit session id, role, peer id, and pairing credential before relay messages are accepted.

#### Scenario: Peer joins with required fields
- **WHEN** a peer connects to the relay with a valid session id, role, peer id, and pairing credential
- **THEN** the relay registers the peer in that session and returns a relay-ready message

#### Scenario: Peer omits required fields
- **WHEN** a peer connects without required join fields
- **THEN** the relay rejects the connection before forwarding any peer message

### Requirement: Two-party relay room
The relay SHALL limit each development session room to one host peer and one viewer peer unless a future OpenSpec change introduces multi-viewer semantics.

#### Scenario: Third peer attempts to join
- **WHEN** a session room already contains a host and a viewer
- **THEN** the relay rejects additional peers for that room

### Requirement: Message schema validation
The relay and agents SHALL validate protocol envelopes before accepting or forwarding messages.

#### Scenario: Invalid protocol message
- **WHEN** a peer sends malformed JSON or an unknown protocol message
- **THEN** the receiver rejects the message and emits an audit/error event without forwarding it as trusted data

### Requirement: Development relay token
The relay SHALL support an optional shared token for local/private development and SHALL document that production deployments require stronger identity and authorization.

#### Scenario: Shared token configured
- **WHEN** the relay is started with a shared token
- **THEN** peers without the matching token are rejected before joining a session room

#### Scenario: Shared token omitted
- **WHEN** the relay is started without a shared token
- **THEN** the relay starts in development mode and logs a warning that it is not production authorization
