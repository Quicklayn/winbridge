## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Host permission revoke simulation
The host shell SHALL send permission revocation messages only when revocation is explicitly configured and the host has already emitted an active visible session state for the same authorization.

#### Scenario: Host revokes granted permission after visible activation
- **WHEN** the host shell is explicitly configured to approve, visible session state is true, and a revoke delay and permission are configured
- **THEN** it sends an approved decision, sends active visible state, sends `permission-revoked` for the configured permission after the delay, and sends an updated authorization state without that permission

#### Scenario: Host revokes final granted permission
- **WHEN** the configured revoked permission is the only granted permission
- **THEN** the updated authorization state has status `revoked` and an empty permission list

#### Scenario: Revoke configured without visible activation
- **WHEN** the host shell is configured to approve but visible session state is false
- **THEN** it does not send `permission-revoked` and does not send an active or revoked state update

#### Scenario: Revoke simulation safety boundary
- **WHEN** the host shell sends revoke simulation messages
- **THEN** it MUST NOT start screen capture, send input, sync clipboard, transfer files, install services, configure startup persistence, collect credentials, or hide the session from the host

#### Scenario: Revoke simulation logging safety boundary
- **WHEN** the agent shell logs received protocol or non-protocol messages during revoke simulation
- **THEN** it MUST log only message summaries and MUST NOT log raw protocol payloads, raw non-protocol text, raw tokens, raw pairing codes, credentials, keystrokes, screenshots, or screen contents
